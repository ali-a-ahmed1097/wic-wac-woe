# wic-wac-woe

The purpose of this project is to develop a functional Tic-Tac-Toe board using factory functions and the module pattern in Javascript. The reason it is titled Wic-Wac-Woe is because it abbreviates to WWW which typically stands for World Wide Web, which is an internet/browser thing, which is what HTML, CSS, and Javascript are typically used for.
